# Visualizing Geospatial Data with H3 Hexagons



## Introduction

This is a h3 visualization project I conducted during my tenure as a Data Scientist intern. The aim of this project is to represent the population, income, and number of charging stations in Taiwan in a 3D hexagonal format on a map of Taiwan, in order to generate more ideas for future charging station deployment. The conversion of h3 hexagons into 3D format primarily utilized the Python third-party package, Ellipse.

## Data Source

1.	Taiwan Population and income data on the socio-economic data service platform. [Platform Link](https://segis.moi.gov.tw/STAT/Web/Platform/QueryInterface/STAT_QueryTopProduct.aspx )
2.	Charging station : The data on charging station locations across Taiwan is confidential as it originates from a company source.
